# Boilerplates
Boilerplates are pre-configured projects, that are meant to give a good head start when building larger applications. They tend follow best practices for the technologies that they incorporate, with the better ones keeping a good, up to date documentation on how to use and extend them. 

Bad part about boilerplates is that once you start developing on top of one, it is hard to keep track of its future updates, as you have to apply them manually.
