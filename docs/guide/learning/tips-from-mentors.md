This chapter will give you an insight from Vue experts on how they began with Vue, how they approach learning new technologies and other helpful tips.

I started learning Vue back when it was v0.12, at the time the main learning resources were the docs, the forum and Laracasts. Hard times, but even then, the docs were very good, with enough examples to get you started.

I began tinkering with some basic applications, but without a proper scope or any previous reactive framework experience, it was hard to escape from old habits. **TIP:** think of a nice, yet simple idea for an app, one that you can expand further as you progress. With a clear idea, tasks fly a lot smoother.

I split with a colleague a few courses and books, like Laracasts and Majesty of Vue, which helped with further increasing our confidence when writing modern applications. **TIP:** if you feel a course is worth it, but it would break the bank, ask your boss to help or split the expenses with a colleague/friend. I've done this a few times while learning.

As I began to delve a bit deeper into OSS, bundlers, transpilers, etc, I faced the same problem as before, a lot of information, scattered all over the place. **TIP:** don't be afraid to open a library's `src` files and check how it works. Often times methods or properties are unintentionally left out from the docs. Check tests, if they have any, as those could give you a more clear idea on how certain features work. I often looked into ESLint and Babel presets to find out what they include.
