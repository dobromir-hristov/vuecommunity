# Making a case for Vue at your company

Other than showing your own enthusiasm and trust in Vue.js by providing your own reasoning as for why Vue.js is a better fit in your opinion. It's important to know how to counter those arguments and how to back them up with data and links to related articles and sources.

## In defense of Vue.js

Here's a list of the most common arguments against the use of Vue.js that may be used in a discussion, with hints on how to deal with them. Some of those arguments may be more or less valid depending on the case, so it's important to not only provide a reasoning against them, but also explain what Vue.js community does to mitigate the issues.

### Argument against Vue

*Short description of the argument and its variants*

Reasoning against it and data to back it up. 

### Vue.js lacks the backing of a big company and is a one man project

*The lack of a large company backing is the most often argument raised in such discussions. This also includes the accusations that Vue.js is being written by one person and if Evan You goes away, it won't be properly maintained anymore.*

### It's more difficult to find a good Vue.js developer

*This argument is based on two assumptions: that the difference in userbase between Vue.js and its main alternatives is significant. Because of that, it's more difficult to find experienced developers to hire on the job market.*

The recommended course of action would be to address both mentioned worries. You can show the importance of the low entry level of Vue.js in comparison to other frameworks. Thanks to that, both junior and senior developers can get up to speed with Vue faster. This makes the adoption easier, as the company can spend less resources on educating their developers. In a result, Vue.js can be a more productive and a cheaper option at the same time.

There is also less competition on the market for experienced Vue.js developers, so it doesn't necessarily have to be more difficult at all. In fact, the gap between the number of job adverts for React or Angular is way bigger than the gap in the workforce, so this may play to the advantage of Vue.js.

### It's more difficult to find help with Vue.js

*Another argument based on the size of the community and ecosystem around Vue.js. A commonly mentioned data to back it up is the number of Stack Overflow answers.*

### There's not enough success stories of big companies using Vue.js

### There's no clear set of best practices and guidelines of how to use Vue.js on enterprise level

### There's no native mobile solution as good as React Native
