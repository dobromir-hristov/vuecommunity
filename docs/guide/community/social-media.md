# Media

## Official Chat

Official Vue.js chat on Discord gathers thousands of developers from around the world. The most popular channels are #need-help where you can share your issues with code and #general if you have some questions about Vue.js itself. Other channels are dedicated to particular topics, such as #best-practices, #vuex, #jobs or #mobile-apps. 

The main language on the chat is English, but there are also rooms for conversations in other languages. On the other hand, many bigger libraries for Vue.js have their own Discord servers or chats on other platforms, so they don't have their own channel on VueLand. We list them in one of the next sections.

Remember that people you discuss with are not obligated to provide help and that they're not there all the time, so it can take a while or ten to receive answer. It may also vanish under other messages. If your problem is more complex and can take longer to solve, it may be wiser to share it on the forum and then link it on the chat.

Occasionally the chat's team organizes Q&A sessions with important members of Vue.js community. Each such Q&A has its specific topic and two or more special guests answering the questions.

## Official Forum

Official Vue forum is a SEO friendly alternative to the chat. It's especially helpful if you expect to take longer to get the answer and can afford to wait for it. The forum's team is managed by Thorsten LÃ¼nborg, but you can also find help from other Core Team members there from time to time.

## Stack Overflow

[Stackoverflow's Vue.js](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/vue.js/info) section is a common place for people to ask questions related to programming with Vue.

## Newsletters

Vue.js News is an official Vue.js weekly newsletter, curated by Damian Dulisz, member of the Vue.js Core Team. There's also a video version of it, prepared by Adam Jahr and Gregg Pollack from VueMastery learning platform. 

If you want your new resource covered in the upcoming edition, submit it using the form on the website. While the newsletter typically shows up on Tuesday, the podcast has to be prepared sooner, so make sure to submit your content until Sunday. If some articles, libraries or tutorials are missed in the current edition, they may still show up next week.

## Vue People

[VuePeople.org](https://vuepeople.org) is an interactive map of Vue.js developers and enthusiasts around the world, with a possibility to filter them with tags. The plan for the future is to make it network that connects the Vue.JS community not only with each other, but also with events and work opportunities. You can register via your Github account.

## Influential people on Twitter

Twitter is the first place where developers share updates on their packages, discuss ideas, point out findings, do polls or just ask for advice. 
 
The list of influential people is ever expanding, and Dobromir Hristov's post [List of influential Twitter profiles in Vue.js](https://medium.com/hypefactors/list-of-influential-twitter-profiles-in-the-vue-js-community-state-of-2018-cca15ec1144a) is doing a good job at collecting some of the most socially active developers on Twitter in the Vue community and in the JavaScript world in general.
