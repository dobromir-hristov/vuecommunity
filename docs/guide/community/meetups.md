# Meetups and Events

Meetups and Events hold a crucial role in building a strong community. Both newcomers and seasoned developers can benefit from meeting and interacting with people from various levels of expertise and backgrounds.

A typical meetup can vary from just a gathering at a bar/restaurant, to more learning oriented ones, where speakers give small talks, on a topic they are passionate about. The first part is better for bonding and finding fresh blood, where as the second one is better for leveling up the group's expertise. Both attendees skills as well as the speaker's teaching abilities can greatly improve with such events.
