# Meetups and Events

Meetups and Events hold a crucial role in building a strong community. Both newcomers and seasoned developers can benefit from meeting and interacting with people from various levels of expertise and backgrounds. 

A typical meetup can vary from just a gathering at a bar/restaurant, to more learning oriented ones, where speakers give small talks, on a topic they are passionate about. The first part is better for bonding and finding fresh blood, where as the second one is better for leveling up the group's expertise. Both attendees skills as well as the speaker's teaching abilities can greatly improve with such events.

## Spread the Word
> Ben, maybe add this to the website directly, as it doesnt really make sense to be here?

You can popularize your event by announcing it on the Official Vue Chat, Tweeting with hashtag #VueJS and #VueJSMeetups or even directly write to [VueMeetups](https://twitter.com/vuemeetups) on Twitter.

You can also ask on Discord to be promoted to a Community Leader, so you can discuss and share experience with other meetup organizers around the world.

If you want Vue stickers to giveaway at meetups, you can contact the people at [VueJobs](https://vuejobs.com/), they give them out for free for meetup organisers.
