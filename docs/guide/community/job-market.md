Below is a list of common skills that employers are looking for in candidates and make a very good impression when mastered. 

No one is expecting you to know them all, but the more you know, the better first impression you will make.

  - Multi level component communication - Vuex, Buss or other pub-sub mechanism, Vue Events - when should you chose one over hte other, pros and cons.
  - Popular Vue framework knowledge - When does it make sense to use a framework and when not. Which one can fit for the job without major rewrite of styles or functionality.
  - Mobile Device Framework - Should you go with a PWA, Native code compiled or Cordova Hybrid app. Pro's and Cons of each.
  - Large Form Handling - How to handle large, complicated forms, reuse common logic across components, data validation.
  - Code Reusability - Methods of sharing code across components - Mixins, Factories, Services, Store Actions, Utility Functions.
  - Component Framework Styling Patterns - What naming patterns to choose when styling components. Should you go with `BEM`, `SMACSS`, `Scoped` or `Module` styles. Would preprocessors make sense in the project.
  - Code Documentation - Ways of documenting components and related code - `JSDOC`, `.ts` definitions, Component usage examples.
  - Popular Coding Standards (ESLint, Prettier) - Understanding the need for ESLint or Prettier in a project. How to set it up and when to override popular presets.
  - Basic Webpack Knowledge - Knowing how Webpack works and to setup its build chain is always a plus, even when using Vue CLI.
  - Code Optimisation - Dynamic Imports (when does it make sense), Code Speed Optimisation, Time to first paint, General Page Speed Optimisations, Working on slow networks.

I advice you to apply for a position, even if you don't cover all the points. Depending on the position, most of the times there will be a senior developer guiding you to improve where you are lacking.
  
  - Dont answer interview questions with just one word. Explain very briefly why you chose that answer.
  - If a project is still in discussion phase, you can steer towards using Vue as a framework by showcasing usage examples and it's benefits.
  - Do some research about the company. Does it use Vue for other projects. Does it contribute to Open Source libraries. Does it boast a healthy working environment.
