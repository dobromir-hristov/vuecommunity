## How to sell Vue to your boss

The lack of a large company backing Vue is the First thing companies point at when being offered Vue for their projects. Compared to React and Angular, Vue is entirely Open Source and community driven,
with big decisions being made by the whole community. The framework has shown an incredible growth in both popularity and adoption on the past year with no signs of slowing down.

The entry level compared to other popular frameworks is very low, so developers of any experience level can get up to speed with Vue in a matter of days. This makes adoption in both smaller and larger companies
easier as they can spend less time and money on educating their developers.

Vue's progressive nature means it can be embedded to both fresh projects and those that are already in production, written with various other javascript libraries in mind.

It has a very live and evolving social community, where people constantly share technical posts, ask questions, share ideas and organize meetups.

Among the many smaller companies, Vue.js is used in big companies like Gitlab, Adobe, Alibaba and more. Check Montreal's article on [State of Vue 2017]() where they go into much more detail on how and why 
those large companies chose Vue for their projects.

## What skills are employers looking for in Vue Developers

There are many fields where a developer can emphasize on, when applying for a job. Are you good at working on mobile apps? Do you feel comfortable being involved in writing styles for the company framework. Do you mind

No one is expecting you to know them all, but the more you know, the better first impression you will make.

  - Popular Vue framework knowledge - When does it make sense to use a framework and when not. Which one can fit for the job without major rewrite of styles or functionality.

## Tips from Skilled Vue Devs

Here are some tips from senior Vue Developers on how to approach interviews and score a good job.
  
  - Dont answer interview questions with just one word. Explain very briefly why you chose that answer.
  - If a project is still in discussion phase, you can steer towards using Vue as a framework by showcasing usage examples and it's benefits.
  - Do some research about the company. Does it use Vue for other projects. Does it contribute to Open Source libraries. Does it boast a healthy working environment.
