## How to sell Vue to your boss

The lack of a large company backing Vue is the First thing companies point at when being offered Vue for their projects. Compared to React and Angular, Vue is entirely Open Source and community driven,
with big decisions being made by the whole community. The framework has shown an incredible growth in both popularity and adoption on the past year with no signs of slowing down.

The entry level compared to other popular frameworks is very low, so developers of any experience level can get up to speed with Vue in a matter of days. This makes adoption in both smaller and larger companies
easier as they can spend less time on educating their developers.

Vue has a very live and evolving social community, where people constantly share technical posts, ask questions, share ideas and organize meetups.

Among the many smaller companies, Vue.js is used in big companies like Gitlab, Adobe, Alibaba and more. Check Montreal's article on [State of Vue 2017]() where they go into much more detail on how and why 
those large companies chose Vue for their projects.
