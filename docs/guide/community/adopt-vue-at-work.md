# Making a case for Vue at your company

Selling the idea to use Vue.js in the upcoming company project or a rewrite of legacy application is a difficult task that requires some preparation. Both the higher ups and your coworkers may have different experience, preferences and bias toward alternative technologies. They may come with multiple arguments against the use of Vue.

Other than showing your own enthusiasm and trust in Vue.js by providing your own reasoning as for why Vue.js is a better fit in your opinion. It's important to know how to counter those arguments and how to back them up with data and links to related articles and sources.

## Strongest points of Vue.js

* Easy to get started with
* Easily readable components
* Progressively embeddable into websites
* Can work without build tools

## In defense of Vue.js

Here's a list of the most common arguments against the use of Vue.js that may be used in a discussion, with hints on how to deal with them. Some of those arguments may be more or less valid depending on the case, so it's important to not only provide a reasoning against them, but also explain what Vue.js community does to mitigate the issues.

### Argument against Vue

_Short description of the argument and its variants_

Reasoning against it and data to back it up.

### Vue.js lacks the backing of a big company and is a one man project

_The lack of a large company backing is the most often argument raised in such discussions. This also includes the accusations that Vue.js is being written by one person and if Evan You goes away, it won't be properly maintained anymore._

### It's more difficult to find a good Vue.js developer

_This argument is based on two assumptions: that the difference in userbase between Vue.js and its main alternatives is significant. Because of that, it's more difficult to find experienced developers to hire on the job market._

The recommended course of action would be to address both mentioned worries. You can show the importance of the low entry level of Vue.js in comparison to other frameworks. Thanks to that, both junior and senior developers can get up to speed with Vue faster. This makes the adoption easier, as the company can spend less resources on educating their developers. In a result, Vue.js can be a more productive and a cheaper option at the same time.

There is also less competition on the market for experienced Vue.js developers, so it doesn't necessarily have to be more difficult at all. In fact, the gap between the number of job adverts for React or Angular is way bigger than the gap in the workforce, so this may play to the advantage of Vue.js.

### It's more difficult to find help with Vue.js

_Another argument based on the size of the community and ecosystem around Vue.js. A commonly mentioned data to back it up is the number of Stack Overflow answers._

Vue.js has its own forum where you can find lots of the most common questions already answered. Along with that is the Vueland Discord Chat, which has a very active userbase, who help and answer user questions. Last by not least is the Vue Docs, which usually has answers to most of the questions new Vue developers are looking for.

Stack overflow also helps but the quality of the answers there is not always great.

### There's not enough success stories of big companies using Vue.js

_Argument lies on the small amount of large or popular companies that use Vue in their applications_

This argument is also a bit misleading to the people living in the Western world. Vue has a huge market share in Asia, where titans in the industry use it on a daily basis.

Here is a nice post by Michał Sajnóg on Netguru titled [13 Top Companies That Have Trusted Vue.js](https://www.netguru.com/blog/13-top-companies-that-have-trusted-vue.js-examples-of-applications) which does a good job at listing some of those big companies.

### There's no clear set of best practices and guidelines of how to use Vue.js on enterprise level

_This argument was actually a valid one for quite some time. As large companies started adopting Vue in their projects, none of them shared patterns or tips to the Vue userbase._

Currently one of the most referenced Vue enterprise resources is Chris Fritz's [Vue Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/) which is filled with good practices for large scale Vue applications.

You can a look at our [Boilerplates](../ecosystem/boilerplates.md) page, where we dive deeper into the official Vue boilerplates.

### There's no native mobile solution as good as React Native

_Argument coming from the fact that Vue does not have a solution like React Native, which is kind of an official way to write truly Native mobile applications in React_

Even though Vue does not have an official solution, like React Native for React, its versatility has allowed for a few very good solutions to come up like Nativescript-Vue, Quasar and Vue Native.
