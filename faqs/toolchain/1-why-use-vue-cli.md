question: When and why should I use Vue CLI?

Vue CLI can save you hours of configuration, before you even start a project. It comes with Webpack pre-configured for bundling Vue apps. This means developers can focus on building the app it self, rather then configuring build processes.

You can use Vue CLI from the beginning, when you are just starting out with Vue, as it will not interfere with the learning process.
