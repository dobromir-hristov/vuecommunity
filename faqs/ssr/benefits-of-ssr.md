Server side rendering can help tremendously with SEO and website speed. 

Upon visit, pages are rendered on the server, which usually has higher processing power and faster internet connection, giving an impression of a faster page load.

This will also boost SEO as the HTML will be fully rendered upon visit, helping crawlers to scan the website easier.
