If you want something that just works with little to no configuration, go with **Nuxt**. To have more freedom and to configure most of the things yourself, **Ream** is a good pick. If you need to have full control and setup everything yourself, then **Vue Server Renderer** is the one for you.

You might also take a look at [Static site generators](../ecosystem/static-site-generators.md) as those might be a better pick for simpler, more static websites, like personal blogs, portfolios, product pages and so on.
