question: What kinds of websites can take advantage of being an SPA?

SPA websites are most suitable for web applications, aka Software as a Service, where the user interacts with the website as he would with a desktop application/program. 

That isnt to say, that you cant build blogs, presentational websites or landing pages, they would just require extra steps to be fully competitive to standard server rendered websites.
