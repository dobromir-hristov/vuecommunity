question: How do I pass data to a sibling?

You could leverage the parent as a relay, so emit data to it. The parent binds that data down to other components, but that can be a bit cumbersome.

You can also use the same techniques as described in [How do I pass data to distant component](#how-do-i-pass-data-to-distant-component).
