question: When should I use a UI Library?
category: UI Libraries
---

UI libraries are perfect for smaller projects or those that are in a hurry, where time does not allow for building a set of custom UI components. Such libraries offer a wide range of pre-built components and utilities, that can dramatically increase the development speed of an application.

UI libraries tend to come pre-styled though, so keep this in mind when choosing. Would you need to restyle and if so, how much effort would it take? Is the library's css flexible enough to allow for the required changes? How well is the said library supported, does it have an english community?
